# German Credit Risk Prediction — Decision Trees & Ensemble Techniques 🙂

Build and compare **Decision Trees** and **Ensemble models** to classify loan applicants as **Good** or **Bad** credit risks (often interpreted as **non-defaulter vs defaulter**).

## Project Goal
Predict whether a person seeking a loan is likely to be:
- **Good credit risk** (safer / likely to repay), or
- **Bad credit risk** (riskier / likely to default)

Using applicant attributes such as **checking balance**, **credit history**, **purpose**, **loan amount**, **duration**, etc.
